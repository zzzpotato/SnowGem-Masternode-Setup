# SnowGem-Masternode-Setup
Bash script for easily installing a masternode on a linux vps

Note: This script is a beta and has only been tested on ubuntu 16.04. Report any bugs and I will do my best to fix them.

## Create a sudo user so you are not running as root
Replace username with an actual username such as "node"
```
adduser username
usermod -aG sudo username
su username
cd ~
```

## Download
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zzzpotato/SnowGem-Masternode-Setup/master/masternode-setup.sh; chmod 755 masternode-setup.sh
```

## Run the script
```
bash masternode-setup.sh
```

## Updating your masternode

If you need to update your masternode you "can" run this again after stopping your daemon and moving/removing "snowgem-wallet". However you should use this instead:
